          <p>
            4.1 All accounts are opened and transacted in Pound Sterling only.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 Deposits and withdrawals can be made only by using debit cards
            registered to your name and address. You must be the rightful owner
            of money used to make deposits. We use third party payment service
            providers to store your card details and process payment made
            through the App.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 Due to administrative costs, the minimum amount you can deposit
            into your account is £5.00 and the minimum you can withdraw from
            your account in any single transaction is £20.00.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4 Withdrawals from your account will be processed immediately but
            the money can take up to 3-5 working days to reach your bank
            account, depending on the processing times of your bank or card
            holder.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.5 Please note that your bank can take up to 5 working days to
            return withdrawals to your debit card. Our preferred method of
            payment is to return funds directly to the debit card which was used
            to deposit previously.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.6 In relation to anti-money laundering regulations, we have the
            right to raise queries in relation to the source of customer funds
            placed on deposit. You agree to assist us with any additional due
            diligence request made by providing the information requested
            promptly. Further information that may be required includes evidence
            of how your account is funded, proof of your earnings etc. For
            example, if you are trying to deposit over £2,500 in any single
            transaction then we may put a stop on the transaction until we have
            obtained further information from you about the source of your
            funds. We may suspend or terminate your account and pass on your
            information to the necessary regulatory authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.7 Our anti-money laundering regulatory obligations require us to
            perform further due diligence checks on customer withdrawals over
            certain threshold amounts, if this has not been covered at deposit.
          </p>

            manner.

          <p>
            4.9 If we suspect that you may have cheated or where there is
            suspicion around the integrity of behaviour then we may withhold
            payment of winnings pending the outcome of an investigation into the
            matter.

            6. Entry Fees and Prize Money
        -------------------------------------- */}
        <section>
          <h2>6. Entry Fees and Prize Money</h2>
          <p>
            6.1 Entry fees and the allocation of prize winnings vary depending
            on the game type, number of entrants and the rules set by the
            creator of the game. See the specific game rules for more
            information on payout structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2 The chance of winning depends on several factors, including the
            number of participants, the number of rounds, the rules of the
            competition, and the skill level of the participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2.1 Depending on your choices made within the "last man standing"
            game, your chance of winning increases as more players are
            eliminated. The more gameweeks you progress through, the more likely
            it is that you can win the prize pot, less the PANNA admin fee (5%
            of the league pot in that round for private leagues, and 10% of the
            league pot in that round for public leagues). Example: If there are
            100 participants at the beginning of round 1 in "last man standing"
            round in X league, and by week 5, only 10 participants remain, your
            chance of winning has significantly increased compared to the
            beginning. As players get eliminated each week based on their
            selections, your odds improve. The final prize pot you compete for
            will have the admin fee deducted, so if the pot is £1,000 in a
            public league, you will compete for £900 after the 10% admin fee is
            taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2.2 The only possible prizes from the use of PANNA are either the
            total prize pot, or an equal share of the prize pot, depending on
            the game rules set by the “captain” during league creation. This
            prize pot is proportional to the number of players in the league,
            for example a league with a £10 buy-in consisting of 20 players
            amounts to a total pot of £200 and with 50 players the pot equals
            £500.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2.3 If you are successful in winning a round, you will be notified
            in-app and your winning funds will be settled into your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2.4 You will be notified in-app if at any stage we alter the
            prize(s) on offer and receive an email regarding information about
            the changes made.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.3 We reserve the right to decline the whole or part of any entry
            fee that you may attempt to pay to use our platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.4 It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the
            entry fee amount that will be taken from your account and that you
            have sufficient funds available in your account before you commit to
            paying the entry fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.5 Entry fees that have already been paid to join or create a game
            are non-refundable. Once you have agreed to join or create a game
            you cannot ask for your entry fee to be returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.6 If any player initiates a charge-back, reversal or otherwise
            cancels their payment of their entry fees contrary to clause 2.3
            then the total prize pool in respect of that pot will be reduced by
            the amount of that player’s entry fee. We will not charge our
            administration fee on any entry fees that have been removed from the
            prize pot.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.7 If we have reason to believe that a series of entry fees paid by
            separate customers in respect of the same pot have been paid by or
            for the same individual or syndicate of individuals, we reserve the
            right to void all entry fees and without the payment of any
            winnings, pending the outcome of an investigation into the matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.8 We reserve the right to alter, suspend or remove any of our
            services at any time, without prior notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.9 If you win the LMS league, we will pay you the total league pot
            (“Winnings”), less our Game fee (“Game Fee”). The Game Fee is
            deducted from your Winnings, so the amount you receive from us will
            be less than the total Winnings collected from you and your
            participating Team members.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.10 We aim to initiate payment of your Winnings (less our
            non-refundable Game Fee and any taxes in respect of the Game Fee) to
            you within three working days of the completion of the Event, but
            this will not always be possible. The time it takes for you to
            receive the Winnings (less our non-refundable Game Fee and any taxes
            in respect of the Game Fee) may vary depending on our method of
            payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.11 We may change your Game Fee at any time on the provision of
            notice to you in writing, by email or through your use of the App,
            save that no changes to our Game Fee will be applied in respect of a
            Game in progress at the time the change takes effect. Your continued
            use of the App following notice of such change shall be deemed to be
            your acceptance of the new Game Fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.12 If you do not agree with the changes to the Game Fee, we advise
            against joining any other leagues on our app.
