          <h2>3. Your Account</h2>
          <p><strong>3.1</strong> Customer funds are held entirely separately from company funds in a customer account separated from our normal, day-to-day business accounts. We are required by our licence to inform customers about what happens to funds which we hold on account for you in the event of insolvency. (<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-gambling-businesses/Compliance/General-compliance/What-you-need-to-tell-us/Protecting-customer-funds.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="external-link">https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-gambling-businesses/Compliance/General-compliance/What-you-need-to-tell-us/Protecting-customer-funds.aspx</a>). Monies deposited with us are held in accounts separate from our company funds. These funds are not protected in the event of insolvency.</p>
          <p><strong>3.2</strong> You agree not to charge-back, reverse or otherwise cancel any deposits made into your account. If you chargeback any deposited funds, you will be eliminated from our platform. We may also close your account and terminate our relationship with you if you persistently breach our conditions. If you have any credit balance with us then you agree that we are entitled to deduct any associated costs e.g. bank charges from your account.</p>
          <p><strong>3.3</strong> Each transaction carried out on our platform is recorded. For further details see the banking section, accessed via "My Account" within the platform.</p>
          <p><strong>3.4</strong> It is your responsibility to account to the relevant tax authorities with respect to any taxation which may apply to your betting activity on our platform.</p>
          <p><strong>3.5</strong> To participate with our services, you need to send money to us. We use third-party electronic payment processors to process all financial transactions. You authorise us to instruct our third-party payment processors to handle deposits and withdrawals from your account and agree that we may give instructions on your behalf in accordance with your requests or as a result of your activity with us.</p>
          <p><strong>3.6</strong> You must not use our services for any purpose that can be classed as defamatory, abusive, obscene, unlawful, of a racist nature, sexist or other discriminatory nature which could cause offence. If you engage in any behaviour prohibited under this clause 3.6 then we reserve the right to close your account immediately.</p>
          <p><strong>3.7</strong> Our services are for your personal use. Any commercial use of our services by you is not permitted unless we give you permission to do so.</p>

          <h2>4. Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
          <p><strong>4.1</strong> All accounts are opened and transacted in Pound Sterling only.</p>
          <p><strong>4.2</strong> Deposits and withdrawals can be made only by using debit cards registered to your name and address. You must be the rightful owner of money used to make deposits. We use third party payment service providers to store your card details and process payment made through the App.</p>
          <p><strong>4.3</strong> Due to administrative costs, the minimum amount you can deposit into your account is £5.00 and the minimum you can withdraw from your account in any single transaction is £20.00.</p>
          <p><strong>4.4</strong> Withdrawals from your account will be processed immediately but the money can take up to 3-5 working days to reach your bank account, depending on the processing times of your bank or card holder.</p>
          <p><strong>4.5</strong> Please note that your bank can take up to 5 working days to return withdrawals to your debit card. Our preferred method of payment is to return funds directly to the debit card which was used to deposit previously.</p>
          <p><strong>4.6</strong> In relation to anti-money laundering regulations, we have the right to raise queries in relation to the source of customer funds placed on deposit. You agree to assist us with any additional due diligence request made by providing the information requested promptly. Further information that may be required includes evidence of how your account is funded, proof of your earnings etc. For example, if you are trying to deposit over £2,500 in any single transaction then we may put a stop on the transaction until we have obtained further information from you about the source of your funds. We may suspend or terminate your account and pass on your information to the necessary regulatory authorities.</p>
          <p><strong>4.7</strong> Our anti-money laundering regulatory obligations require us to perform further due diligence checks on customer withdrawals over certain threshold amounts, if this has not been covered at deposit.</p>
          <p><strong>4.8</strong> Any queries with regards to our services should be directed to info@panna-app.uk. We will make every effort to resolve the matter in a mutually satisfactory manner.</p>
          <p><strong>4.9</strong> If we suspect that you may have cheated or where there is suspicion around the integrity of behaviour then we may withhold payment of winnings pending the outcome of an investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p><strong>5.1</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or close your account at any time for any reason set out in these terms and conditions. In addition, any violation of our services or service rules shall be deemed a breach of this agreement.</p>
          <p><strong>5.2</strong> You have the right to close your account at any time. Once your account has been deleted, you cannot get it back. This means that if you have outstanding bets, these shall be forfeited and you will not receive any of the relevant outstanding monies.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Entry Fees and Prize Money</h2>
          <p><strong>6.1</strong> Entry fees and the allocation of prize winnings vary depending on the game type, number of entrants and the rules set by the creator of the game. See the specific game rules for more information on payout structures.</p>
          <p><strong>6.2</strong> The chance of winning depends on several factors, including the number of participants, the rules of the competition, and the skill level of the participants.</p>
          <p><strong>6.2.1</strong> Depending on your choices made within our games, your chance of winning increases as more players are eliminated. The more gameweeks you progress through, the more likely it is that you can win the prize pot, less the PANNA admin fee (0% of the pot for private games and 10% of the pot for public games). Example: If there are 100 participants at the beginning of a "last man standing" game, and by week 5, only 10 participants remain, your chance of winning has significantly increased compared to the beginning. As players get eliminated each week based on their selections, your odds improve. The final prize pot you compete for will have the admin fee deducted in public leagues, so if the pot is £1,000, you will compete for £900 after the 10% admin fee is taken.</p>
          <p><strong>6.2.2</strong> The only possible prizes from the use of PANNA are either the total prize pot, or a percentage of the prize pot, depending on the specific game rules.</p>
          <p><strong>6.2.3</strong> If you are successful in winning a game, you will be notified in-app and your winning funds will be settled into your account.</p>
          <p><strong>6.2.4</strong> You will be notified in-app if at any stage we alter the prize(s) on offer and receive an email regarding information about the changes made.</p>
          <p><strong>6.3</strong> We reserve the right to decline the whole or part of any entry fee that you may attempt to pay to use our platform.</p>
          <p><strong>6.4</strong> It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the entry fee amount that will be taken from your account and that you have sufficient funds available in your account before you commit to paying the entry fee.</p>
          <p><strong>6.5</strong> Entry fees that have already been paid to join or create a game are non-refundable. Once you have agreed to join or create a game you cannot ask for your entry fee to be returned.</p>
          <p><strong>6.6</strong> If any player initiates a charge-back, reversal or otherwise cancels their payment of their entry fees contrary to clause 2.3 then the total prize pool in respect of that pot will be reduced by the amount of that player's entry fee. We will not charge our administration fee on any entry fees that have been removed from the prize pot.</p>
          <p><strong>6.7</strong> If we have reason to believe that a series of entry fees paid by separate customers in respect of the same pot have been paid by or for the same individual or syndicate of individuals, we reserve the right to void all entry fees and without the payment of any winnings, pending the outcome of an investigation into the matter.</p>
          <p><strong>6.8</strong> We reserve the right to alter, suspend or remove any of our services at any time, without prior notice.</p>
          <p><strong>6.9</strong> If you win a public LMS game, we will pay you the total league pot ("Winnings"), less our Game fee ("Game Fee"). If you win a private LMS game, we will pay you the total league pot ("Winnings").</p>
          <p><strong>6.10</strong> We aim to initiate payment of your Winnings to you within three working days of the completion of the Event, but this will not always be possible. The time it takes for you to receive the Winnings (less the Game Fee and any taxes in respect of the Game Fee) may vary depending on our method of payment.</p>
          <p><strong>6.11</strong> We may change your Game Fee at any time on the provision of notice to you in writing, by email or through your use of the App, save that no changes to our Game Fee will be applied in respect of a Game in progress at the time the change takes effect. Your continued use of the App following notice of such change shall be deemed to be your acceptance of the new Game Fee.</p>
          <p><strong>6.12</strong> If you do not agree with the changes to the Game Fee, we advise against joining any other leagues on our app.</p>

          <p><strong>7.2</strong> PANNA may use both automated processing techniques and human review teams to detect and review information available to us including account, group, and community profile information, as well as reported messages for potential violations of these guidelines.</p>
          <p><strong>7.3</strong> In the event of any violation of these terms, we reserve the right to temporarily or permanently suspend an account on our service.</p>

          <h2>18. Mobile Marketing Terms And Conditions</h2>
          <p>The PANNA mobile messaging service (the "Service") is operated by Prosper Sports Limited. ("PANNA", "we", "our" or "us"). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions ("Mobile Marketing Terms"). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Marketing Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. By consenting to our terms and conditions, you agree to receive SMS/text messages from and on behalf of PANNA through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialling system or other technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., account updates, betting alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., reminders, bonus offers). You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to use our services, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase or use of PANNA's services. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary. We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider. You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to PannaSMS or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. For Service support email support@panna-app.uk We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honouring requests made in such messages. The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with your new number. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Service.
